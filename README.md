# HR Analytics: Predicting Employee Promotions

This project was completed as part of my graduate coursework in applied machine learning. The goal was to build a classification model to predict whether an employee is likely to be promoted based on HR data. Our approach combined exploratory data analysis, rule mining, and supervised machine learning algorithms, with a strong emphasis on interpretability and business relevance.

## Project Structure

- `hr_promotion_model.py`: Main machine learning code using scikit-learn and imbalanced-learn.
- `eda_and_rules.R`: Data preprocessing, visualization, and association rule mining in R.
- `HR Analytics Predicting Employee Promotions Project.docx`: Final report.
- `Final Presentation.pptx`: Slide deck summarizing the project.

## Highlights

- Algorithms used: Random Forest, SVM (linear, poly, RBF), Naive Bayes, Decision Trees
- Applied NearMiss sampling and SMOTE to address class imbalance
- Used Apriori rule mining in R to uncover promotion patterns
- Final Random Forest model achieved an F1-score of 0.89
